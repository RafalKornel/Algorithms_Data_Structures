# Algorithms and Data structures

This repository contains common data structures and algorithms, implemented by me in TypeScript (deno).

Main purposes of this repository are:
- learning experience
- library of commonly used data structures that can be used in my other projects

## Contents

- Trees
    - Traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
    - Binary searcg tree
    - Breadth first traverse
    - Comparison
    - Trie

- Graphs
    - Breadth first search (adjacency matrix)
    - Depth first search (adjacency list)
    - Dijkstra shortest path algorithm

- Linked lists
    - Uni-directional linked list
    - Queue
    - Stack

- Sorting Algorithms
    - Bubble sort
    - Quick sort

- Binary search


- Ring-buffer

- Hash map

- MinMax heap

... and few algorithmic problems solutions


## Tests
